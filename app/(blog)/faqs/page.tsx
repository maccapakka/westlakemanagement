          You train in Self Defence – Why?
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Physical attacks are rare but they are of significant risk to
            require training, however the biggest factor in deterring an attack
            is confidence – and knowing that you can escape should the worst
            happen gives you that confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not just about physical skills – very few incidents go
            physical, we predominately teach Conflict Management to give people
            the verbal skills to manage an incident and get out.

            No – Training is suitable for absolutely everyone – we have trained
            people of all ages and physical conditions. All training relies on
            technique.

          Why do front line staff need this Protection?
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Front line staff take a lot of abuse and put themselves in a lot of
            personal danger. For example, when a tenant contacts the Housing
            Association and mentions an anti social neighbour, who goes out
            first? Not the Police – the housing officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Front line staff are undervalued and under supported. Police have
            the protection of the uniform – hit a policeman and you go to prison
            – hit a front line worker and more than likely nothing will happen.

          What are the Rewards of working with front line staff?
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            Front line staff are in the job they are because they are selfless
            and they care for others. They are bright intelligent and articulate
            people who could have successful careers in safer and more
            appreciative professions – but they choose to give to others.
          </p>

            Who would not want to spend their working time with such people and
            have the privilege of helping them?

          Do the courses frighten staff?
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            No. The staff are very aware of the risks and are grateful for the
            fact that the organisation has seen fit to invest in their personal
            safety. All the courses are delivered with humour – not to diminish
            the seriousness of the situation but to provide a fun based learning
            environment.

          How do you keep the training in line with the law?

          <p>
            I look after our legal and training update work. Essentially the
            laws surrounding our training have not changed for years, but
            interpretations have and more to the point the particular laws of
            Reasonable Force have always been contentious, but since the Tony
            Martin case have become more so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Delegates often mix up their moral and personal feelings over the
            law with the law itself and we must be crystal clear as to where the
            law draws the line – particularly in the age of malicious
            prosecution.

            As a member of Cheshire Police Authority I am able to keep up to
            date with daily changes in Police and Home Office thinking and
            interpretation.

            In relation to Conflict Management we study latest thinking in Neuro

            At present we are studying the way that the brain reacts to sound –
            ever wonder why we react more to the sound of a phone ringing? –
            even if someone is in front of you and talking you will interrupt
            them and take the telephone call as a priority.

          <p>
            In regard to Breakaway we regularly get together and ‘fight’ – not
            literally but we look at common forms of attack as well as the more
            unusual ones and study how the attack is made. Then we study the
            defence!
