        Armed Self Defence
      </h2>

      <p>
        The UK has seen increases in violent crime with a growth in the use of
        weapons. Westlake has the skills to train staff how to manage, control
        and ultimately escape from these frightening situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        All training in this field is based upon the principle of last resort
        with the emphasis placed upon diffusing and escaping from an attack â€“
        however there can be situations where these preferred options are not
        available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Training is in Firearms (long & short barrel), sticks, baseball bats,
        bottles, knives and syringes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Westlake would prefer never to train in this area, however regrettably
        staff are facing assaults with weapons. Weapons training will not
        prevent an incident; however it will aid escape and reduce risk.
