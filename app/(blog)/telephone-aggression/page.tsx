        Telephone Aggression Aggression (Face to Face and Telephone)

      <p>
        As an ever increasing number of customer communications are carried out
        by telephone, managing aggression through this medium is more important.
      </p>

      <p>
        The loss of body language means that handlers cannot gauge reactions and
        customers are more abusive because they do not see the consequences of
        their words on others.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary role is to calm a situation, gain control and influence the
        behaviour of the caller to the point where everyday customer service
        techniques can be applied. Not only does the Westlake course achieve
        this through a range of psychological influencing skills it further
        strengthens and support staff on the frontline of threatening and
        abusive calls.
      </p>

      <p>
        A large ‘toolbox’ of techniques are made available to delegates to
        achieve this, enabling organisations to retain and support front line
        staff – putting the in control of situations.
