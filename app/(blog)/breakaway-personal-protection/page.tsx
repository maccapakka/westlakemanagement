      <p>
        Breakaway Personal Protection Training isn’t about turning your
        employees into “Kung Fu” experts. It’s all about learning a few simple
        techniques, both psychological and physical, designed to give you and
        your staff the “edge” in a potentially difficult or volatile situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal Protection Training is simple, cost effective and could save
        lives. The course takes just over three hours and teaches how to escape
        from an attack and then run!
