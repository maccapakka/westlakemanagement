        Transactional Analysis Conflict Management
      </h2>
      <p>
        As financial pressures increase on organisations, changes in the
        relationships with clients mean that conflict will occur as the process
        of change occurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The implementation of Transactional Analysis (TA) will change
        relationships, however they will also provide further conflict until
        understood and accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course not only provides an explanation and background to TA, it
        further explains in practical terms how to implement and apply the
        process as well as then giving staff the skills and support to cope with
        any additional conflict.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course gives many simple psychological techniques to achieve and
        develop communication in anger situations, passing through ‘everyday’
        and into extreme circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course further puts staff back in control of the situation and
        supports them as they face such difficulties on an all too regular
        basis.
