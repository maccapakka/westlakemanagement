        memorable presentation with a twist.

        Overcoming the ‘negative’ attitudes to H&S presentations is the key

        Health & Safety isn’t just about ladder training and cones on slippery
        floors – it’s all about preventing injuries and saving lives. Do your
        staff appreciate this? Do you wish that your staff would take these
        matters more seriously?

        and explains why we have Health & Safety law, what the laws are and what
        they mean – Rights and Responsibilities.

        The course also teaches COSHH, RIDDOR, risk assessment and how to
        complete your company accident form.

        aim to make Health & Safety interesting – the course we offer will make
        your staff sit up and take note of this critical area of employment law.
