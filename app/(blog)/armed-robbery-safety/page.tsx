        Armed Robbery Safety
      </h2>
      <p>
        As banks and Post Offices become increasing protected criminals are
        looking for ‘softer’ targets on which to carry out raids. Large sums of
        cash may not be involved but the trauma and certainly the danger to
        staff are not reduced by the size of the sums involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply telling staff to “Do as you are told” is not enough as evidence
        must be preserved, descriptions taken and most important of all the
        staff must have their post incident care managed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protect both your staff and organisation from the negative effects of
        such a terrifying incident. You may never remove the risk of an armed
        assault on your premises, but you can staff support through an incident
        and manage the post incident impact.
